PCRE Ruby extension ver0.1

This is Ruby Regex extension module using libpcre.

The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5.
PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API.
The PCRE library is free, even for building commercial software.(http://www.pcre.org)

This module is a litte faster than Ruby standard Regex.
It has some additional features like lookbehind assertion (?<=, (?<!.
